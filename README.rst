This plugin provides a ``BraketEngine`` class for running photonic quantum circuits created in Strawberry Fields on the Amazon Braket service.

.. header-start-inclusion-marker-do-not-remove

The `Amazon Braket Python SDK <https://github.com/aws/amazon-braket-sdk-python>`__ is an open source
library that provides a framework to interact with quantum computing hardware
devices and simulators through Amazon Braket.

`Strawberry Fields <https://strawberryfields.readthedocs.io>`__ is an open source library for writing
and running programs for photonic quantum computers.

The plugin documentation can be found here: `<https://amazon-braket-strawberryfields-plugin-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__.

Features
========

This plugin provides the classes ``BraketEngine`` for submitting photonic circuits to Amazon Braket and ``BraketJob`` for tracking the status of the Braket task.

``BraketEngine`` and ``BraketJob`` have the same interfaces as ``RemoteEngine`` in Strawberry Fields and ``Job`` in the Xanadu Cloud Client, respectively, and can be used as drop-in replacements:

.. code-block:: python

    from braket.strawberryfields_plugin import BraketEngine

    eng = BraketEngine("arn:aws:braket:us-east-1::device/qpu/xanadu/Borealis")
    result = eng.run(prog, shots=1000)  # Synchronous, returns sf.Result
    job = eng.run_async(prog, shots=1000)  # Asychronous, returns BraketJob
    print(job.status)

Installation
============

Before you begin working with the Amazon Braket Strawberry Fields Plugin, make sure 
that you installed or configured the following prerequisites:


* Download and install `Python 3.7.2 <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`__ or greater.
  If you are using Windows, choose the option *Add Python to environment variables* before you begin the installation.

* Make sure that your AWS account is onboarded to Amazon Braket, as per the instructions
  `here <https://github.com/aws/amazon-braket-sdk-python#prerequisites>`__.

* Download and install `Strawberry Fields <https://strawberryfields.readthedocs.io/en/stable/_static/install.html>`__:

  .. code-block:: bash

      pip install strawberryfields


You can then install the latest release of the Strawberry Fields-Braket plugin as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install amazon-braket-strawberryfields-plugin


You can also install the development version from source by cloning this repository and running a 
pip install command in the root directory of the repository:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/aws/amazon-braket-strawberryfields-plugin-python.git
    cd amazon-braket-strawberryfields-plugin-python
    pip install .


You can check your currently installed version of ``amazon-braket-strawberryfields-plugin`` with ``pip show``:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip show amazon-braket-strawberryfields-plugin


or alternatively from within Python:

.. code-block:: python

    from braket import strawberryfields_plugin
    strawberryfields_plugin.__version__

Tests
~~~~~

Make sure to install test dependencies first:

.. code-block:: bash
